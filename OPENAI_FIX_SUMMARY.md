# OpenAI API Key Fix Summary

## Issue
The OpenAI API features were not working because the `.env` file was not being loaded properly in the main configuration files.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `backend/config.py`
Added automatic loading of environment variables from `.env` file:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
```

### 2. Updated `backend/local_config.py`
Added the same dotenv loading to ensure consistency:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
```

### 3. Verified OpenAI API Key
- Confirmed `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
- Verified API key format is correct (starts with `sk-proj-`)
- Tested API connectivity successfully

## Verification

All AI-powered services have been tested and confirmed working:
- âœ… **Claim Generator Service** - Generates research claims using GPT-4o-mini
- âœ… **Investigation Service** - Formalizes claims and runs investigations
- âœ… **Code Generator Service** - Generates test code for hypotheses
- âœ… **Backend Server** - Started successfully on http://localhost:5001
- âœ… **Frontend** - Running on http://localhost:3000

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **All OpenAI API features are now working!**

The application is currently running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5001
- **API**: http://localhost:5001/api

## Testing AI Features

You can now use all AI-powered features in the application:

1. **Agent Console** - Test investigations and experiments
2. **Market Creation** - AI-generated research claims
3. **Code Generation** - Automated hypothesis testing
4. **Claim Investigation** - Automated research evaluation

## Logs

To monitor the services:
```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f backend/backend.log

# Frontend logs
tail -f frontend/frontend.log
```

## Managing Services

```bash
# Start services
./start.sh

# Stop services
./stop.sh
```

## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file in `backend/` directory contains:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - âœ… Configured and working

## Notes

- The fix ensures that `.env` variables are loaded before any configuration is accessed
- The OpenAI API key is now properly available to all services
- No code changes are needed in the service implementations
- The fix is persistent across application restarts
