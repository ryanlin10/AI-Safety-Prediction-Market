# Interactive Trading System - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

You now have a fully functional prediction market trading system with:
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** pricing
- **Interactive buy/sell buttons** showing real-time prices
- **Transaction recording** in the database
- **Dynamic price charts** showing market history
- **Real-time price updates**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Market Maker Algorithm** (`backend/app/services/market_maker.py`)
- **Algorithm**: Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM)
- **Formula**: Similar to Uniswap's x * y = k
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand
  - Automatic slippage calculation
  - Market depth analysis
  - Initial liquidity: $1,000 per market

#### 2. **New API Endpoints** (`backend/app/routes/bets.py`)

**GET `/api/markets/<id>/prices`**
- Returns current buy/sell prices for all outcomes
- Includes liquidity information
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

**POST `/api/markets/<id>/buy`**
```json
{
  "outcome": "Yes",
  "amount": 10
}
```
- Purchases shares at current market price
- Automatically records transaction
- Returns updated prices

**GET `/api/markets/<id>/price-history`**
- Returns complete price history
- Shows how prices changed over time
- Used for charting

#### 3. **Transaction Recording** (`backend/app/models/bet.py`)
- Every trade is recorded as a Bet
- Includes:
  - Outcome purchased
  - Amount of shares
  - Price paid (stake)
  - Timestamp
  - Rationale/notes

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **Trading Interface** (`frontend/src/pages/MarketDetail.tsx`)
- **Buy Buttons**: Interactive purchase buttons for each outcome
- **Price Display**: Shows price per share in dollars
- **Amount Selector**: Adjust number of shares to buy
- **Total Cost**: Real-time calculation of purchase cost
- **Liquidity Display**: Shows available liquidity

#### 2. **Price Chart**
- **Library**: Recharts
- **Features**:
  - Line chart for each outcome
  - Time-series price history
  - Interactive tooltips
  - Automatic color coding

#### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- Prices refresh every 5 seconds
- Chart updates after each trade
- Optimistic UI updates

## üí∞ Pricing Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Initial State**:
   - Each outcome starts with equal liquidity: $1,000 / n_outcomes
   - Initial price = 1/n (e.g., 50% for Yes/No market)

2. **After Buying**:
   - Buyer adds stake to their outcome's pool
   - Price increases for that outcome
   - Other outcomes' prices decrease proportionally

3. **Price Formula**:
   ```
   Price(outcome) = Pool(outcome) / Total_All_Pools
   ```

4. **Buy Cost Formula**:
   ```
   Cost = (k / new_outcome_pool - current_other_pools) * 1.005
   where k = outcome_pool * other_pools_total (constant product)
   ```

### Example

**Market**: "Will GPT-5 be released in 2026?"
- **Outcomes**: Yes, No
- **Initial**: Yes = 50%, No = 50%
- **Initial Liquidity**: $500 each

**After buying 10 YES shares for $52.50**:
- YES pool: $552.50
- NO pool: $500
- New prices: YES = 52.5%, NO = 47.5%

## üìä Features

### 1. Dynamic Pricing
- Prices move based on supply/demand
- More trades = more price movement
- Includes 0.5% fee

### 2. Market Depth
- Shows liquidity available
- Prevents manipulation
- Transparent pricing

### 3. Price Charts
- Historical price tracking
- Multiple outcomes on one chart
- Hover for details

### 4. Transaction Book
- All trades recorded in `bets` table
- Includes timestamp, outcome, amount
- Can track individual user portfolios

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Users

1. **Navigate to a Market**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click on any market

2. **View Prices**
   - See current probability percentages
   - Check buy price per share
   - Review liquidity

3. **Buy Shares**
   - Select number of shares (1-100)
   - See total cost calculation
   - Click "Buy [Outcome]"
   - Transaction recorded instantly

4. **Watch Price Changes**
   - Price chart updates automatically
   - See your impact on the market
   - Track price trends

### For Developers

**Testing the API**:
```bash
# Get current prices
curl http://localhost:5001/api/markets/1/prices

# Buy 10 YES shares
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/markets/1/buy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"outcome": "Yes", "amount": 10}'

# Get price history
curl http://localhost:5001/api/markets/1/price-history
```

**Database Queries**:
```python
# Get all transactions for a market
from app.models import Bet
bets = Bet.query.filter_by(market_id=1).all()

# Calculate total volume
total_volume = sum(bet.stake for bet in bets)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Adjust Initial Liquidity
```python
# backend/app/services/market_maker.py
market_maker = MarketMaker(initial_liquidity=2000.0)  # Default: 1000.0
```

### Change Fee Rate
```python
# In calculate_buy_price()
cost_with_fee = cost * 1.01  # Change from 1.005 (0.5%) to 1.01 (1%)
```

### Adjust Auto-Refresh Rate
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/MarketDetail.tsx
refetchInterval: 10000,  // Change from 5000 (5s) to 10000 (10s)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Prices Not Updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/health`
- Check network tab in DevTools

### Buy Button Not Working
- Verify market status is "active"
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure amount is between 1-100

### Chart Not Showing
- Need at least 2 trades for chart to appear
- Check if price history API returns data
- Verify Recharts is installed: `npm list recharts`

### Backend Errors
```bash
# View logs
tail -f backend/backend.log

# Restart backend
./stop.sh && ./start.sh
```
